The plot surrounds the vengeful spirits 'onryo', of a woman and her daugher-in-law. ",

        "rating": "8.75/10 stars <br> For myself, this film captures a very important message through the use of horror and japanese folklore. As a culture that has always <br> praised its soliders and samurai, to see a film challanging the usual narrative is both interesting and inspiring to see the art of <br> cinema being used as social commentary. Furthermore, the director uses incredible techniques to capture this ghost story. The use <br> of lighting and framing techniques to create an atmosphere that is seeming stuck between reality and a ghost world is impressive,<br> especially with only black and white colour.",

        "rating": "8/10 stars <br> This film is really fun and entertaining, especially around Halloween. <br> This film captures the classic slasher film cliches while also doing something special. <br> This film really does capture the carelessness of summer for teenagers, yet also carries an eerie interpersonal twist. Definatly <br> a lighter, more fun horror film. There is a deeper message embedded in this film, however its arguably not the primary focus.",

        "rating": "9/10 stars <br> This movie is plausibly one of the best horror/psycholigical trillers ever made and some of Kubricks best work. <br> The main reason I find this film so well done is Shelley Duval's acting. She basically acts by herself for most of the film. Acting alone without much help of <br> other actors or actresses is difficult. Not to mention, the emotional termoil Kubrick put her through while filming. For the directing <br> and stroy telling, Kubrick nails the slow  build up of Jack going insane. You really feel like no one is safe",
